Scenario 1: Testing Equals Method with Same CreditCard Object

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObject.
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the equals method returns true when comparing the same CreditCard object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a CreditCard object and set its properties.
  Act: Call the equals method on the CreditCard object, passing in the same object as the argument. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is true.

Validation: 
  The equals method should return true when comparing an object to itself. This test validates that the equals method correctly implements this aspect of the equivalence relation contract.

Scenario 2: Testing Equals Method with Different CreditCard Object Having Same Properties

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentObjectSameProperties.
  Description: This test is to check if the equals method returns true when comparing two different CreditCard objects with the same properties.

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate two different CreditCard objects and set their properties to be the same.
  Act: Call the equals method on one of the CreditCard objects, passing in the other object as the argument. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is true.

Validation: 
  The equals method should return true when comparing two objects that have the same properties. This test validates that the equals method correctly implements this aspect of the equivalence relation contract.

Scenario 3: Testing Equals Method with Different CreditCard Object Having Different Properties

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentObjectDifferentProperties.
  Description: This test is to check if the equals method returns false when comparing two different CreditCard objects with different properties.

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate two different CreditCard objects and set their properties to be different.
  Act: Call the equals method on one of the CreditCard objects, passing in the other object as the argument. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.

Validation: 
  The equals method should return false when comparing two objects that have different properties. This test validates that the equals method correctly implements this aspect of the equivalence relation contract.

Scenario 4: Testing Equals Method with Null

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithNull.
  Description: This test is to check if the equals method returns false when comparing a CreditCard object with null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a CreditCard object.
  Act: Call the equals method on the CreditCard object, passing in null as the argument. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.

Validation: 
  The equals method should return false when comparing an object to null. This test validates that the equals method correctly implements this aspect of the equivalence relation contract.

Scenario 5: Testing Equals Method with Different Class Object

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject.
  Description: This test is to check if the equals method returns false when comparing a CreditCard object with an object of a different class.

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a CreditCard object and an object of a different class.
  Act: Call the equals method on the CreditCard object, passing in the different class object as the argument. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.

Validation: 
  The equals method should return false when comparing an object to an object of a different class. This test validates that the equals method correctly implements this aspect of the equivalence relation contract.
