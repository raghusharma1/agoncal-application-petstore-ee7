"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify the default value of street2

  Details:
    TestName: testDefaultStreet2.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the default value of the street2 attribute is null or not.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an Address object.
    Act: Call the getStreet2() method on the Address object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the default value of street2 is null when not explicitly set. This test is significant because it ensures that uninitialized Address objects do not contain unexpected data.

  Scenario 2: Test to verify the value of street2 after setting it

  Details:
    TestName: testSetAndGetStreet2.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the setStreet2() method successfully changes the value of the street2 attribute.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an Address object and set the street2 attribute to a known value.
    Act: Call the getStreet2() method on the Address object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the previously set value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the setStreet2() method correctly sets the value of the street2 attribute. This test is significant because it confirms that the setStreet2() and getStreet2() methods function as expected.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify the value of street2 after multiple set operations

  Details:
    TestName: testMultipleSetAndGetStreet2.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the setStreet2() method successfully changes the value of the street2 attribute even after multiple set operations.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an Address object, set the street2 attribute to a known value, change the value of street2 using the setStreet2() method.
    Act: Call the getStreet2() method on the Address object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the most recently set value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the setStreet2() method correctly sets the value of the street2 attribute, even after multiple set operations. This test is significant because it confirms that the setStreet2() method functions as expected even when called multiple times on the same object.

  Scenario 4: Test to verify the value of street2 in the toString() method

  Details:
    TestName: testStreet2InToString.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the toString() method correctly includes the value of the street2 attribute in its output.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an Address object and set the street2 attribute to a known value.
    Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned string contains the value of the street2 attribute.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the toString() method correctly includes the value of the street2 attribute in its output. This test is significant because it confirms that the toString() method correctly reflects the state of the Address object.
