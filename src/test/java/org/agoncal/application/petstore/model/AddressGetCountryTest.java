"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the getCountry method returns the correct country

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsCorrectCountry
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getCountry method correctly returns the country that was set for the Address object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a specific Country to it.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned country matches the one that was set.

Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method correctly retrieves the country of an address. The expected result is the same country that was set because the getter method is supposed to return the exact value that was set. This test is significant in ensuring that the getter method functions as expected, which is crucial for retrieving address details accurately.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getCountry method returns null when no country is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsNullWhenNoCountrySet
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getCountry method returns null when no country has been set for the Address object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a country.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned country is null.

Validation:
  This assertion aims to check that the getCountry method correctly handles a scenario where no country was set for an address. The expected result is null because no country was set. This test is significant in ensuring that the method can handle such a scenario gracefully without causing unexpected errors.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getCountry method returns the most recently set country

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsMostRecentlySetCountry
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getCountry method returns the most recently set country when the country of an Address object is updated.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a specific Country. Then, update the country to a different one.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned country matches the most recently set country.

Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method correctly retrieves the most recent country of an address when the country is updated. The expected result is the most recently set country. This test is significant in ensuring that the getter method reflects the most current state of the Address object.
