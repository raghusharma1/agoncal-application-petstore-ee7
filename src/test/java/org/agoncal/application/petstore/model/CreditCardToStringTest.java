"""
Scenario 1: Test the correctness of the toString method in the CreditCard class.

Details:
  TestName: testToStringMethod.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the toString method of the CreditCard class returns the correct String representation of a CreditCard object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard class and set the creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate fields.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the result of the toString method with the expected String representation of the CreditCard object.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly formats the String representation of a CreditCard object. This is important for logging and debugging purposes, as well as for displaying credit card information to the user in a readable format.

Scenario 2: Test the toString method with null values in the CreditCard fields.

Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithNullFields.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the toString method handles null values in the CreditCard fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard class without setting any of the fields (leave them as null).
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the result of the toString method with the expected String representation of the CreditCard object with null fields.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the toString method handles null fields gracefully and does not throw a NullPointerException. This is important to ensure that the application does not crash when displaying credit card information with missing fields.

Scenario 3: Test the toString method with empty strings in the CreditCard fields.

Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithEmptyFields.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the toString method handles empty strings in the CreditCard fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard class and set the creditCardNumber and creditCardExpDate fields as empty strings.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the result of the toString method with the expected String representation of the CreditCard object with empty fields.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the toString method handles empty strings in the fields without throwing any exceptions or errors. This is important to ensure that the application can handle credit card information with empty fields.
