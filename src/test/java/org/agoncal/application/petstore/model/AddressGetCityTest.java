"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the getCity method returns the correct city

  Details:
    TestName: testGetCityReturnsCorrectCity.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getCity method correctly retrieves the city from the Address entity.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address entity and set a known city using setCity method.
    Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned city matches the city that was set.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getCity method correctly retrieves the city from the Address entity. This is important for ensuring accurate retrieval of address data.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if the getCity method returns null when no city is set

  Details:
    TestName: testGetCityReturnsNullWhenNoCityIsSet.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getCity method correctly handles scenarios where no city has been set in the Address entity.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address entity without setting a city.
    Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned city is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getCity method correctly handles scenarios where no city has been set. This is important for ensuring robust error handling in the Address entity.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if the getCity method returns the correct city after multiple setCity calls

  Details:
    TestName: testGetCityReturnsCorrectCityAfterMultipleSetCityCalls.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getCity method correctly retrieves the most recent city set in the Address entity, even after multiple setCity calls.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address entity and set a city multiple times using the setCity method.
    Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned city matches the most recent city that was set.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getCity method correctly retrieves the most recent city set in the Address entity. This is important for ensuring accurate retrieval of address data when the data changes over time.
