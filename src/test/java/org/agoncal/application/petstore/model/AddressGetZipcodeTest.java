ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getZipcode_3a16b4b54f

Scenario 1: Test to check if the getZipcode method returns the correct zipcode.

Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcode.
  Description: This test checks if the getZipcode method of the Address class returns the correct zipcode that was previously set using the setZipcode method.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the Address class is created and a zipcode is set using the setZipcode method.
  Act: The getZipcode method is called on the Address instance.
  Assert: The returned zipcode is checked to see if it matches the zipcode set earlier.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getZipcode method correctly retrieves the zipcode of the Address instance. The expected result is that the zipcode returned is the same as the one set earlier. This test is significant as it ensures that the getZipcode method works as expected, which is crucial for the retrieval and display of the correct address information.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getZipcode method returns null when no zipcode has been set.

Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeReturnsNull.
  Description: This test checks if the getZipcode method of the Address class returns null when no zipcode has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the Address class is created without setting a zipcode.
  Act: The getZipcode method is called on the Address instance.
  Assert: The returned zipcode is checked to see if it is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getZipcode method correctly handles the scenario where no zipcode has been set. The expected result is that null is returned. This test is significant as it ensures that the getZipcode method can handle scenarios where the zipcode hasn't been set, which is a possible situation in the lifecycle of an Address instance.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getZipcode method returns the correct zipcode after multiple sets.

Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeAfterMultipleSets.
  Description: This test checks if the getZipcode method of the Address class returns the correct zipcode after the zipcode has been set multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the Address class is created and the zipcode is set multiple times using the setZipcode method.
  Act: The getZipcode method is called on the Address instance.
  Assert: The returned zipcode is checked to see if it matches the last zipcode set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getZipcode method correctly retrieves the most recent zipcode set on the Address instance. The expected result is that the returned zipcode matches the last one set. This test is significant as it ensures that the getZipcode method correctly reflects changes to the zipcode of an Address instance, which is important in scenarios where the zipcode may be updated.
