"""
Scenario 1: Test getState method when the state is set
Details:
  TestName: testGetStateWhenStateIsSet
  Description: This test scenario is designed to check the functionality of the getState method when the state has been set. The expected outcome is that the method should return the state that was set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set its state to a known value, for example, 'California'.
  Act: Invoke the getState method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned state against the known state that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method correctly retrieves the state that was set. The expected result is 'California'. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the getState method, ensuring it correctly retrieves the state of an Address object.

Scenario 2: Test getState method when the state is not set
Details:
  TestName: testGetStateWhenStateIsNotSet
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check the functionality of the getState method when the state has not been set. The expected outcome is that the method should return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting its state.
  Act: Invoke the getState method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned state is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method correctly handles the scenario when the state has not been set. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it validates the method's error handling capability when retrieving an unset state.

Scenario 3: Test getState method after changing the state
Details:
  TestName: testGetStateAfterStateChange
  Description: This test scenario is designed to check the getState method's functionality after the state of an Address object has been changed. The expected outcome is that the method should return the new state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set its state to a known value. Then, change the state to a different value.
  Act: Invoke the getState method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned state against the new state.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method correctly retrieves the new state after it has been changed. The expected result is the new state. This test is significant as it ensures the getState method accurately reflects changes in the state of an Address object.
