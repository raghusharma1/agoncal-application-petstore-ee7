"""
Scenario 1: Test hashCode with identical Address objects

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test is designed to check that the hashCode method generates the same hash for two Address objects with identical properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with identical street1, city, and zipcode properties.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both Address objects.
  Assert: Check that the hashes returned by the two calls to hashCode are identical.
Validation:
  The hashCode method is expected to produce the same result for objects with the same properties. This test is crucial in ensuring that objects with the same properties are correctly identified as identical in the context of a HashSet or HashMap.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode with different Address objects

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentObjects
  Description: This test is designed to check that the hashCode method generates different hashes for two Address objects with different properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different street1, city, and zipcode properties.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both Address objects.
  Assert: Check that the hashes returned by the two calls to hashCode are different.
Validation:
  The hashCode method is expected to produce different results for objects with different properties. This test is important to ensure that objects with different properties are not mistakenly identified as identical.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode with null properties

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullProperties
  Description: This test is meant to check that the hashCode method can handle Address objects with null properties without throwing a NullPointerException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with null street1, city, and zipcode properties.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Check that the hash returned by the hashCode method is not null.
Validation:
  The hashCode method should be able to handle null properties without throwing an exception. This test is crucial in ensuring the robustness of the hashCode method in different scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test hashCode with empty properties

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithEmptyProperties
  Description: This test is designed to check that the hashCode method can handle Address objects with empty string properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with empty string street1, city, and zipcode properties.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Check that the hash returned by the hashCode method is not null.
Validation:
  The hashCode method should be able to handle empty string properties without throwing an exception. This test is crucial in ensuring the robustness of the hashCode method when dealing with different object states.
