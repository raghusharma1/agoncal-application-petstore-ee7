  Scenario 1: Test to get valid Credit Card Number

  Details:
    TestName: testGetValidCreditCardNumber
    Description: This test aims to check the ability of the method getCreditCardNumber to return the correct credit card number that has been previously set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of CreditCard and set a known credit card number using setCreditCardNumber method.
    Act: Invoke the method getCreditCardNumber.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the credit card number returned by the getCreditCardNumber method matches the number that was set.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getCreditCardNumber method is correctly retrieving the credit card number from the CreditCard instance. This is important to ensure that the correct credit card number is used for all credit card operations.

  Scenario 2: Test to get null Credit Card Number

  Details:
    TestName: testGetNullCreditCardNumber
    Description: This test aims to check the behavior of the method getCreditCardNumber when the credit card number is not set (null).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of CreditCard without setting a credit card number.
    Act: Invoke the method getCreditCardNumber.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the credit card number returned by the getCreditCardNumber method is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getCreditCardNumber method correctly handles the case where the credit card number is not set. This is important to prevent null pointer exceptions when the credit card number is accessed.

  Scenario 3: Test to get empty Credit Card Number

  Details:
    TestName: testGetEmptyCreditCardNumber
    Description: This test aims to check the behavior of the method getCreditCardNumber when the credit card number is set as an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of CreditCard and set an empty string as the credit card number using setCreditCardNumber method.
    Act: Invoke the method getCreditCardNumber.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the credit card number returned by the getCreditCardNumber method is an empty string.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getCreditCardNumber method correctly handles the case where the credit card number is set as an empty string. This is important to handle edge cases where the credit card number may not be properly initialized.
