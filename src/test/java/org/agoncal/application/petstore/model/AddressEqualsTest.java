"""
Scenario 1: Test for identical addresses

Details:
  TestName: testIdenticalAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method returns true when comparing an address object to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing in the same address object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two address objects are identical. This is important for preventing duplicates in collections of addresses.

Scenario 2: Test for null object

Details:
  TestName: testNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method returns false when the compared object is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing in null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies a null object. This is crucial for avoiding NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 3: Test for different class object

Details:
  TestName: testDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method returns false when the compared object is of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and a String object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Address object, passing in the String object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when an object is of a different class. This is important for maintaining type safety in the application.

Scenario 4: Test for equal addresses

Details:
  TestName: testEqualAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method returns true when comparing two different address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one Address object, passing in the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two address objects represent the same logical address. This is important for correctly grouping or sorting addresses based on their values.

Scenario 5: Test for unequal addresses

Details:
  TestName: testUnequalAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method returns false when comparing two different address objects with different street1, city, or zipcode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different street1, city, or zipcode.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one Address object, passing in the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two address objects represent different logical addresses. This is important for correctly distinguishing between different addresses in the application.
