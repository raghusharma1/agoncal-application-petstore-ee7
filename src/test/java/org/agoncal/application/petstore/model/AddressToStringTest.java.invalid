Scenario 1: Test to check if toString method returns correct string representation of Address object

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringOnValidAddressObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method of the Address entity correctly converts the Address object to a string representation. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and set all fields (street1, street2, city, state, zipcode, country) with some valid data.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on this object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual string returned by the toString method against the expected string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly converts the Address object into a string representation. The expected result is based on the known format of the string representation. This test is significant as it ensures that the toString method is functioning as expected, which is crucial for debugging and logging purposes.

Scenario 2: Test to check if toString method handles null fields correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringOnAddressWithNullFields
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method of the Address entity can handle null fields without throwing a NullPointerException. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and set some fields to null.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on this object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual string returned by the toString method against the expected string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method can handle null fields and still return a correct string representation. The expected result is based on the known format of the string representation where null fields are represented as 'null'. This test is significant as it ensures that the toString method is robust and can handle null fields, which is a common scenario in real-world applications.

Scenario 3: Test to check if toString method returns correct string representation for Address object with empty fields

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringOnAddressWithEmptyFields
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method of the Address entity correctly converts an Address object with empty fields to a string representation. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and set all fields to empty strings or null (for the Country object).
  Act: Invoke the toString method on this object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual string returned by the toString method against the expected string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly converts an Address object with empty fields into a string representation. The expected result is based on the known format of the string representation where empty fields are represented as empty strings (''). This test is significant as it ensures that the toString method can handle Address objects with empty fields, which can be a common scenario.
