Scenario 1: Test to check if the method correctly returns the Credit Card Type

Details:  
  TestName: testGetCreditCardType
  Description: This test will validate whether the getCreditCardType() method correctly returns the credit card type that was previously set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set a known CreditCardType using setCreditCardType method. 
  Act: Invoke getCreditCardType() method on the created object.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned CreditCardType with the known CreditCardType that was set.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getCreditCardType method correctly returns the credit card type that was set. This test is significant as it ensures the correctness of the getter method for CreditCardType, which is crucial for retrieving the correct credit card type.


Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns null when no Credit Card Type is set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetCreditCardTypeReturnsNull
  Description: This test will validate whether the getCreditCardType() method correctly returns null when no Credit Card Type is set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object without setting a CreditCardType. 
  Act: Invoke getCreditCardType() method on the created object.
  Assert: Use assertNull to check if the returned CreditCardType is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getCreditCardType method correctly returns null when no credit card type is set. This test is significant as it checks the default behavior of the getter method for CreditCardType when no credit card type is set.


Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns the correct Credit Card Type after a change in the Credit Card Type

Details:  
  TestName: testGetCreditCardTypeAfterChange
  Description: This test will validate whether the getCreditCardType() method correctly returns the new credit card type after a change in the credit card type. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set a known CreditCardType. Change the CreditCardType to a different known CreditCardType using setCreditCardType method. 
  Act: Invoke getCreditCardType() method on the created object.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned CreditCardType with the new known CreditCardType that was set.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getCreditCardType method correctly returns the new credit card type after a change in the credit card type. This test is significant as it ensures the correctness of the getter method for CreditCardType in situations where the credit card type is changed.
