"""
Scenario 1: Validate HashCode Consistency
TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
Description: This test is meant to ensure that the hashCode method returns a consistent hash value for the same CreditCard object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a CreditCard object with predefined creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the CreditCard object twice.
  Assert: Assert that the two hashCodes are equal.
Validation:
  The assertion is checking whether the hashCode method provides consistent results for the same CreditCard object. The expected result is true because, in Java, the hashCode of an object should be consistent during a single execution of a program.

Scenario 2: Validate HashCode Equality for Equal Objects
TestName: testHashCodeEqualityForEqualObjects
Description: This test is meant to check whether two equal CreditCard objects produce the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate two CreditCard objects with identical creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both CreditCard objects.
  Assert: Assert that the two hashCodes are equal.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that two equal CreditCard objects produce the same hashCodes. This behavior is expected as per the contract of the hashCode method in Java, which states that if two objects are equal according to their equals method, then calling hashCode on each of the two objects must produce the same result.

Scenario 3: Validate HashCode Difference for Unequal Objects
TestName: testHashCodeDifferenceForUnequalObjects
Description: This test is meant to check whether two unequal CreditCard objects produce different hashCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate two CreditCard objects with different creditCardNumber, creditCardType, or creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both CreditCard objects.
  Assert: Assert that the two hashCodes are not equal.
Validation:
  The assertion is checking that two unequal CreditCard objects produce different hashCodes. Although it's not a strict requirement for the hashCode method in Java (as two unequal objects can technically have the same hashCode), this test checks for good distribution of hashCodes, which can impact performance in collections.
