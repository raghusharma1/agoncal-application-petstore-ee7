Scenario 1: Test to check if the correct product is returned by getProduct method

Details:
TestName: testGetProductReturnsCorrectProduct
Description: This test is meant to check if the getProduct method returns the correct product that was set for the item.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a product and an item. Set the product for the item using the setProduct method.
Act: Invoke the getProduct method on the item.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the product returned by getProduct method with the product that was set for the item.
Validation:
This assertion aims to verify that the getProduct method returns the correct product that was set for the item. The expected result is that the product returned by the getProduct method should be the same as the product that was set for the item. This is significant as it ensures that the getProduct method is working correctly.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getProduct method returns null when no product is set for the item

Details:
TestName: testGetProductReturnsNullWhenNoProductIsSet
Description: This test is meant to check if the getProduct method returns null when no product is set for the item.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an item without setting a product for it.
Act: Invoke the getProduct method on the item.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the product returned by getProduct method is null.
Validation:
This assertion aims to verify that the getProduct method returns null when no product is set for the item. The expected result is that the product returned by the getProduct method should be null. This is significant as it ensures that the getProduct method handles the case where no product is set for the item correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getProduct method returns the latest product set for the item

Details:
TestName: testGetProductReturnsLatestProductSet
Description: This test is meant to check if the getProduct method returns the latest product that was set for the item.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a product and an item. Set the product for the item using the setProduct method. After that, set another product for the same item.
Act: Invoke the getProduct method on the item.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the product returned by getProduct method with the latest product that was set for the item.
Validation:
This assertion aims to verify that the getProduct method returns the latest product that was set for the item. The expected result is that the product returned by the getProduct method should be the same as the latest product that was set for the item. This is significant as it ensures that the getProduct method returns the most recent product set for the item.
